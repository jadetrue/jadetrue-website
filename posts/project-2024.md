Hey!

I've just wrapped up a project that I'm super excited to share with you; a custom calorie calculator designed specifically for ✨ **women** ✨, hosted on [The Women's Wellbeing Club](http://thewomenswellbeingclub.com/). This tool is a game-changer for anyone looking to take control of their health, offering tailored calorie recommendations based on individual goals, whether it's weight loss, maintenance, or muscle gain.

## The why behind the build

As someone passionate about both coding and fitness, I saw a gap in the market for a calorie calculator that truly understands women's unique nutritional needs. Partnering with my amazing personal coach, [Nicole](https://www.instagram.com/_nawilliams/), we aligned our values to create an easy, effective way for women to understand what their bodies need. The goal? A tool that resonates with women and provides a straightforward, reliable method for managing daily intake.

## The tech behind it

For those of you curious about the details, I built this calculator using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) for a smooth, responsive user experience. This was created without much external design input but using The Women's Wellbeing Club colours & fonts.

## User Experience

One of the main focuses during development was making the calculator as intuitive as possible. The UI is clean, minimalistic, and guides you step-by-step through entering your information. Plus, it's mobile-friendly, so you can calculate your needs on the go.

## Why you should check it out

If you're a woman looking to understand your body's needs better or know someone who might benefit from this tool, give it a try! It's not just about numbers, it's about empowering you to make informed decisions about your health.

## Let’s collaborate

I'm always on the lookout for new projects, especially ones that combine tech and wellness. If you're a business or individual with a vision that aligns with mine, let's chat! Whether it's building a custom tool, improving an existing product, or brainstorming new ideas, I'm here for it.
