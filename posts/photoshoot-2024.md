Hey everyone!

Life has been sooo busy lately. Between starting a new (ish) job, managing my first challenge as a community manager, sticking to my strict fitness plan, and enjoying the highs and lows of a relationship.

Today, I want to take you through a day in my life as I prep for one of the two photoshoots I have this summer! ‚òÄÔ∏è

### My training routine

I'm currently training four times a week:

- 2x upper body
- 2x lower body

Each workout ends with 30 minutes of cardio, and I aim to hit 12,000 steps daily.

On top of this, I run 5km two to three times a week. I am a **very** active person so this really doesn‚Äôt feel like a lot to me but writing it out I can see that it‚Äôs a LOT to the average person.

### The photoshoot

On Sunday, June 30th 2024, I have an exciting photoshoot with my online coach, [Nicole](https://www.instagram.com/_nawilliams/). This shoot is all about capturing a lifestyle and confidence.

Nicole has been my main driver in my journey, focusing on women's well-being and helping me reach this point. If you told Jade seven years ago she'd be doing a photoshoot, she wouldn't believe it! I'm typically quite reserved, but this journey has been transformative for me.

As part of Nicole's team, I encourage women to feel confident at every stage of life‚Ä¶ more to come on this soon in a future post üëÄ

### Lets jump into a day in my life

### Gym days

**5:00 AM**: Get ready and drive to the gym\
**5:30 AM**: Start my session\
**7:00 AM - 8:00 AM**: Get home, have my supplements & breakfast, and shower\
**8:00 AM - 5:00 PM**: At my desk working\
**5:00 PM - 6:30 PM**: Cook and eat dinner\
**6:30 PM - 9:00 PM**: Evenings vary ‚Äì quality time with my partner, me time, a walk if I need more steps, a film, or seeing friends/family\
**9:00 PM**: In bed, asleep before 10

### Active rest days

**6:30 AM - 8:00 AM**: Take a long walk, then have my supplements & breakfast, and shower\
**8:00 AM - 5:00 PM**: At my desk working\
**6:30 PM - 9:00 PM**: Evenings vary ‚Äì quality time with my partner, me time, a walk if I need more steps, a film, or seeing friends/family\
**9:00 PM**: In bed, asleep before 10

Weekends follow a similar structure, though my workout schedule of Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday allows for a bit more flexibility. Saturdays often include a little extra sleep, and since I don't work on weekends, I plan activities to get my steps in or just chill ‚Äì usually seeing friends and playing card games! üé≤

### Food

I am a massive foodie. I love my food, and some people are surprised by the amount I eat considering my size - which shouldn‚Äôt really be how we look at each other, but we do. So, in the lead-up to this photoshoot specifically, I‚Äôve been slowly transitioning into a calorie deficit.

I won‚Äôt go into numbers here because EVERYBODY is different. But for a healthy and consistent weight loss journey, you're looking at about 500-750 fewer calories than your total daily energy expenditure. This might sound like a lot, but it is doable with the right techniques and guidance.

I‚Äôve gradually reduced my calorie intake every couple of weeks, which helps transition to the lower amount without feeling excessively hungry when your aim is to look your leanest. This slow reduction is key; it allows your body to adjust, preventing the feeling of sudden deprivation that often accompanies a sharp calorie drop.

With this decrease in calories, it's essential to focus on nutrient-dense foods to ensure your body gets the vitamins and minerals it needs. My meals are rich in lean proteins, plenty of vegetables, and healthy fats. I make sure each meal is satisfying to keep my energy levels stable throughout the day.

Here‚Äôs a look into my typical day of eating:

**Breakfast:**

- Protein Granola (Aldi/Lidl) with a vanilla protein shake and semi-skimmed milk.
- Sometimes if I am nearer my period days I tend to want something a bit sweeter and filling at the same time, so I‚Äôll opt for porridge with semi-skimmed milk, whack it in the microwave, and then add a scoop of vanilla protein powder\* and top with 2 strawberries & dark chocolate.

**Mid-Morning Snack:**

- I may treat myself here with a biscuit or two.

**Lunch:**

- I love a chicken breast with some veggies and gravy, essentially a mini roast in the middle of the day!
- Occasionally, I switch it up and have scrambled eggs with extra egg whites on whatever bread/bagel I have available.

**Afternoon Snack:**

- I will usually have something sweet here like a kinder bar.

**Dinner:**

- Thai red/green curry with white rice.
- I also enjoy making stir-fries with lots of colourful veggies and chicken as a source of protein!

**Evening Snack (if needed):**

- I‚Äôve been loving the chocolate protein mousses from Aldi recently.

\*I love to use the [MyProtein Impact Whey Powder](https://amzn.to/3XJAwLP)

Hydration is also key. I drink plenty of water throughout the day, aiming for at least 2-3 liters, and I carry a bottle around with me EVERYWHERE. A tip with water: if you think you‚Äôre hungry, have a full glass of water, whether it be with squash, a cup of tea, etc, and see how you feel in the next 30 minutes. If you‚Äôre still thinking you‚Äôre hungry, then you probably need to eat, but if not, most of the time you just need water.

As the photoshoot approaches, I've noticed increased fatigue and lower energy levels, which is expected with reduced calorie intake. It‚Äôs important to listen to your body and adjust accordingly. I ensure I get enough sleep and allow myself rest days when needed.

The key to a successful calorie deficit is not just about eating less but eating smart. By focusing on nutrient-dense foods, staying hydrated, and allowing gradual adjustments, I've managed to prepare for this photoshoot without compromising my health or well-being.

**Bonus Tip:** When having your food, use smaller plates! This little trick can make a massive difference when you feel like the portions look small on your usual size plates!

If you are ever in need of a good healthy recipe, I highly recommend Emily English! Her book is the best cookbook I own, called ‚ÄòSo Good‚Äô, and one that actually gets used in my house because her food is sooooo good.

So, whether you're getting ready for a photoshoot or just looking for some fitness inspiration, remember that confidence comes from within, and it's never too late to start. Feel free to drop me or Nicole a message if you need/want us in your life! üíñ
