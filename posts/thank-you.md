So, a couple of weeks ago, as you may have already read, my partner and I jumped out of a plane to raise money for an amazing charity: [Alzheimer's Support](https://www.justgiving.com/alzheimerssupport). The total between us came to **£1,385** which is incredible.

Thank you so so much to all of our friends, family, colleagues, pets, etc... it really means so much to us and the charity.

A few years ago, I wouldn't have seen myself doing something as extreme as this but there I was, dangling out of a moving plane, 15,000 feet in the air, strapped to an instructor that I had met about 45 minutes earlier for the first time!

The rush as the plane takes off and gradually makes its way up to the jump height is insane, but that is nothing compared to being sat on the edge looking at the world below that just goes on forever. Then the next thing you know, you're being rocked back and forth on the edge, once, twice, and then you're out...

If you haven’t ever tried a skydive, honestly, it is awesome and something that if money was no object, I would do over and over again. The people at [Go Skydive](https://www.goskydive.com/) were just what we needed in the circumstances – friendly, informative and funny!

If you ever get the chance, please do it and if you can do it for a charity that is close to your heart, even better!
