Hey 👋🏻

It feels like ages since I last shared my thoughts here, and I can't believe a whole year has slipped by – but what a year it was! 😅 I'm excited to share the highlights that shaped my journey.

---

**TLDR**; If I were to sum up 2023 in three words, it would be:

- **Disciplined:** From the gym to wedding planning, navigating through these new challenges with determination and dedication.
- **Tough/uncomfortable at times:** Growth often emerges from discomfort. 2023 pushed me out of my comfort zone, teaching me that resilience is born in the test of challenges.
- **Encouraged:** The constant support from loved ones and the belief in myself fueled the journey.

The year unfolded at a pace I couldn't keep up with, throwing new challenges every single day, yet it turned out to be one of the most enriching periods of my life. And you know what? I'm immensely grateful for that because, as they say, growth happens outside our comfort bubble. ✨

Let me share a glimpse into some of the highlights of 2023:

1. **Embracing the gym life 🏋️‍♀️**

To begin the year, I signed up for a local gym membership. I love exercising, but I’ve only ever worked out from the comfort of my own home.

Going to the gym for me was daunting and very much out of my comfort zone; however, it was something I had wanted to do and be confident in. My partner joined me, this helped me build up my confidence by just training in a different environment.

Fast forward to today, and I’ve been to a gym **almost 200** times and I am now in fact a 5 am gym goer! Don’t get me wrong, I still feel uncomfortable at times, and most mornings I don’t want to get up, but it is one of the best things I’ve ever done for myself and my mind.

> 💫 Motivation isn’t a thing that just appears, you need to take action first to generate energy creating motivation.

A couple of months later, I decided to reap the benefits of an online Personal Trainer. BEST DECISION EVER. If you are in a position where you can afford a PT, 100% do it! Even if you’re not into exercising etc. You will learn so much about yourself.

I felt as if my training had plateaued and I wanted a strong back to compliment my ‘dream’ wedding dress which led me to this decision. I say ‘dream’ this way as I never really had an idea of what my dream dress would have been…

2. **Capturing Confidence: Boudoir & Fitness Photoshoots 📸**

In a bold move, I decided to celebrate myself through a boudoir photoshoot, a unique experience that was both empowering and liberating. And hey, why stop there? I also delved into a fitness photoshoot showcasing the dedication and hard work invested in transforming not just my body but my mindset.

3. **Career Adventures: New Job & Commuting Experience 🚆**

Around this time, I was also looking for a new opportunity in my career. I wanted more of a **challenge** and to collaborate more with the team I was working with… an amazing opportunity came up for me but this came with a hefty 1 hour & 30 minutes (either way) commute on a _good_ day so this was a big decision for me to make going from completely remote to 2 days per week (maybe more) in the office.

Talk about a challenge right before the holidays and our wedding!

4. **Love and Commitment: Planning a Wedding 💍**

The most significant highlight was planning my wedding and saying "I do" to the love of my life. The whirlwind of emotions, the detailed planning – it all culminated in a day that surpassed my dreams.

Closing the year on a heartwarming note, my partner and I hosted our first Christmas. The laughter, the joy, and the shared moments made it a celebration to remember. 🎄

Here's to growth, resilience, and the beautiful mess that is life. I'm excited for what 2024 holds, and I can't wait to share more of this journey with all of you. Let's make it a year of new adventures and continued growth together!

Love Jade x
