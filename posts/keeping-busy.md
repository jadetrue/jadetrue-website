Hey!

If you've read my latest blog, you'll know I'm currently seeking a new career opportunity. If you haven't read it yet, feel free to check it out [here](https://www.jadetrue.co.uk/posts/job-searching). So, what have I been doing to keep myself occupied?

Most of those who know me well, sorry, not sorry to those who do 😉, know that I can’t sit still and do nothing. I always like to be moving physically and mentally and therefore with 37 - 40 hours of my week not working at an amazing company I’ve had to challenge myself mentally with other things.

### Learning & Development

I have spent a fair bit of my time keeping up to date with the latest tech news and attending online meetups. A recent meetup I enjoyed was the Smashing Hour with [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/) (CSS Evangelist) - link below.

This was a really insightful hour all about CSS and there were opportunties for the community to ask questions to Kevin about upcoming improvements to CSS and the basics like the best way to center a div in 2024! 😂

Along with this, I have been working on personal projects using [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) for inspiration/designs to keep my skills up to scratch and just because I really love coding ❤️. I have also been challenging myself using [exercism](https://exercism.org/) to gain a deeper understanding of the foundations further.

### Routine

I am a creature of habit. If I don't plan out my week, I am sure that I won't be feeling my best by the end of that disorganised week!

I've maintained a routine as close to normal as possible. During typical working hours, I've actively searched for jobs, improved my CV, and connected with professionals. This keeps my mind active, whether I'm working on personal projects or preparing for interviews. There's always something for me to do.

In addition to this, I've been maintaining my gym routine, going 4 days a week around 5/6 am. The gym is like a sanctuary for me, allowing me to bring energy and positivity to the day ahead. Having a personal goal really helps keep me on top of my goals. Fortunately, my husband is still working, and we coordinate to ensure he can start his work on time as well.

### Downtime

While some might see unemployment as 'free time', for me it's more about balancing productivity and leisure. I need to complete tasks on my to-do list before rewarding myself with activities that I wouldn't usually have time for when working full-time. I've been able to help my in-laws with painting and decorating, as well as provide support to other family members. It's also been fulfilling to spend time with my elderly relatives, who I rarely get the opportunity to see.

Despite not finding a job yet, I remain positive in my search. I will continue to learn, develop my skills, and assist others who may be in a similar situation.
