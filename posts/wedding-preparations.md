In exactly, one year from the date of this blog, I'll be getting married to my better half 👩🏻‍❤️‍💋‍👨🏻✨.

#### How we met...

My partner, Paul and I met each other through work about 5 years ago. We both had a sense of humour and interest in one another and that led to a first date at a curry house. Due to our mutual feelings about 'Valentine's" day we had our first date the day after, which I'll always remember. I was living in Bristol at that time and Paul lived in his own place in Clevedon.

A couple of years on, I ended up moving in with Paul in Clevedon and have been here since. Paul proposed to me in October 2021 on one of our favourite streets in Bristol, [King St](https://goo.gl/maps/3edmstA9MeCBQk727)📍

#### Wedding preparations

So, neither of us has been proposed/married to before therefore everything is new to us! We've had a lot of disagreements already from wedding attire to the guest list and we're still a year out from the big day! 😅

In preparation for the big day, we have decided to use an app called [Bridebook](https://bridebook.com/uk/home) to manage everything including our budget, guests and suppliers. This is a great tool for anyone looking to plan and manage their wedding all in one place.

Currently, a year before the wedding we have:

- 💒 Booked our dream venue
- 📅 Chosen a date
- 🖃 Decided on our Save the Dates
- 📒 Created a "Design brief" on [Canva](canva.com)
- 👥 Curated a _rough_ guest list

Our next steps are to send out our Save the Dates this side of Christmas and start designing/building a wedding website!

#### Useful content

During researching how to plan a wedding, I found a couple of really decent (IMHO) people that have helped me get started with my wedding plans. Lauren below also has a super handy email subscription with so much information, I highly recommend checking this out if you're planning your wedding.
