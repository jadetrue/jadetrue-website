Hey!

I am back with another blog post. And my goal for this year? Is to be writing at least once a month and share my journey with you. And what better way to kick off February than by diving into the world of job hunting?

Challenges? I thrive on them. If I'm not feeling pushed or learning something new, it's time to shake things up.

### Background:

Flashback to 2021 when I officially entered the professional development scene. I‚Äôve now gained a huge insight into what it‚Äôs like to be a developer for some cool projects! From working at a startup on an employee engagement tool, which connected leaders with their teams and empowered people to reach their full potential, to regularly updating a data and payments fintech app that provides open banking, open finance, and open data solutions to the public.

So, why did I leave my previous company after working there for just under 3 months? It was the wrong place wrong time kind of situation.

I'm a creature of habit who thrives on a well-organized work routine. I firmly believe that a clear structure is the key to productivity and job satisfaction. Unfortunately, my last job didn't quite hit the mark on that front, leaving me feeling a bit down and out.

But I have no regrets. I've had a lot of time to reflect on the situation. Could I have prevented it? Maybe.

> üë©üèª‚Äçüè´ **Lesson learned**: Ask about upcoming plans and set clear expectations for the role.

So, here I am, ready for a fresh start.

### What am I looking for?

What's next? A new role that aligns with my values\* and allows me to make a real difference. I would love to grow with a company and be able to have the support of a team who can help me grow and develop personally whilst benefiting the company. I particular love working with JavaScript and am used to working in frameworks like React. I am a fairly quick at learning and picking things up, so I have been told, and would absolutely be up for working in similar frameworks.

The ideal company for me would be a collaborative team that allows for personal growth and challenges. I enjoy working with a team where we can voice our thoughts and opinions whilst receiving constructive feedback on work produced.

I have a lot of enthusiasm to bring to my next role and would love to be given the chance to display this. 

\*My values:

- **Honesty** - I appreciate transparency and believe in being open and straightforward in my communication. It is essential to me to be able to build trust both personally and professionally.
- **Authenticity** - I understand my strengths and weakness and will always be true to myself in what I am / am not capable of. Opening myself up to vulnerabilities and therefor new challenges.
- **Passion** - Being passionate is and always be a top value of mine. I believe that having a passion for something will take you on a path that will bring fulfillment and purpose to ones life. Along with the passion, you have a drive that encourages me to put in the extra effort that's need to thrive.

### Why me?

I am a passionate person for all things tech. I love working on projects that challenge me and anything that can teach me new things (which tech does). I love working with React / NextJS, Tailwind CSS & Storybook (most of which this website is built with). I have 3+ years of experience working as a developer for 3 great companies and am looking for a role to embrace my passion for working with technologies I enjoy using.

Having 4+ years of experience as a Project Manager, I've always wanted to be a developer and this was a goal of mine, so to be working in this line of work at the moment is just amazing for me and I cannot wait to see where I can take myself in future.

### Three things that make me, me:

- Passionate about all animals - especially dogs. I have a mini black and tan dachshund but have always dreamed of a rottweiler since I grew up with them in my family. üêï
- Creative, I enjoy coding and making things look appealing to users. I especially like hand-making cards for Birthdays / Christmas etc and appreciate the finer details. üé®
- I am a very career-driven individual, always looking for new challenges, and got into Frontend Development through self-learning. üíª
