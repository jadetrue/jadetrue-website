Hello! 👋🏻

April has been a busy one for me - which is great and that’s why I am calling it ‘Active April’. I’ve been spending my days 8+ hours a day at my desk. Either working on personal projects using [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges), searching and applying for jobs and also putting myself out there more for different opportunities.

Last night I attended the first [Southwest.js](https://www.meetup.com/southwest-js/) event of 2024 and it was such an inspiring talk. Kicking off the event a speaker shared a lot of invaluable knowledge on sustainability in general with tech in the current world. This took me back to when I did a project for the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation/). It was a great reminder that even small steps towards sustainability can collectively make an impact. If you’re interested I also wrote a blog on this a couple of years ago: [Carbon Hack 22](https://www.jadetrue.co.uk/posts/carbon-hack-22). 🌱🌍

There was also another speaker, who talked about accessibility and making the apps / websites we build available for **everyone**. The event left me with so many ideas and inspiration for future projects I will work on.

Some useful resources I took from this event:

- 17 Global Goals

- [Open Group - OpenFootprint Forum](https://www.opengroup.org/openfootprint-forum) 🌐
- [Architect Tomorrow YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/ArchitectTomorrow) 🎥

Accessibility plugins:

- [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)

I'd love to hear your thoughts on these topics. How do you envision the future of tech in terms of sustainability? Feel free to message me or connect with me on social media! 🌟💬
