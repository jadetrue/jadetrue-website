On Sunday 25th September, my partner and I jumped out of a perfectly good plane to raise money for [Alzheimer's Support Wiltshire](https://www.alzheimerswiltshire.org.uk/). In total we raise just under Â£1,000 for this amazing charity and I'd love to do it all over again!

Able to donate? I really appreciate the support ðŸ’™
