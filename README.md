👋🏻 Hey, welcome to my repo for my [personal website](http://jadetrue.co.uk/)!

I've personally designed and built my website with inspiration from all over. I have chosen to work with NextJS and TypeScript for this particular project as I really enjoy working with them alongside Tailwind CSS to make everything a little prettier.

## Initial desktop designs
